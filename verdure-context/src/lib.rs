//! Verdure Application Context - Context Management for the Verdure Ecosystem
//! 
//! This crate provides application context management as a core part of the Verdure ecosystem
//! framework. It will serve as the central hub for application-wide state, configuration,
//! and environment management that integrates with all other Verdure modules.
//!
//! 
//! # Ecosystem Integration
//! 
//! As a core component of the Verdure ecosystem, this module will integrate with:

//! * **All modules**: Providing cross-cutting context services
//! 
//! # Planned Features
//! 
//! * **Application Context**: Centralized application state management
//! * **Configuration Management**: Hierarchical configuration system
//! * **Environment Profiles**: Support for different deployment environments
//! * **Context-Aware Components**: Components that can adapt based on application context
//! * **Event Broadcasting**: Application-wide event system
//! 
//! # Development Status
//! 
//! This module is currently under development. The API is not yet stable and
//! is subject to change in future releases.
//! 
//! # Future Usage Examples
//! 
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use verdure_context::{ApplicationContext, ConfigurationManager};
//! 
//! // This is a planned API - not yet implemented
//! let context = ApplicationContext::builder()
//!     .with_profile("development")
//!     .with_config_source("config/app.toml")
//!     .build()?;
//! 
//! let database_url: String = context
//!     .get_config("database.url")
//!     .expect("Database URL not configured");
//! ```
//! 
//! Check back in future releases for the implementation of these features.
